Furthermore, I collaborated with the marketing team to enhance the cafe's brand awareness.

    description: In the SASM project, I introduced a curation page that recommends itineraries for places worth visiting. Additionally, I added features such as viewing other users' profiles, as suggested by the design team, to provide users with some enjoyable experiences. In the UPCY project, I aimed to design the interface intuitively to ensure ease of use for customers.
